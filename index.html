          Working through my Computer Science coursework and developing this ePortfolio has been one of the most rewarding aspects of my academic journey. It's given me the opportunity to not only demonstrate what I've learned, but also to reflect on how these experiences have shaped my professional identity and career aspirations.
        </p>
        <p>
          My technical foundation has been built through rigorous coursework in data structures and algorithms, which has taught me to approach complex problems with efficiency and precision. The hands-on experience I've gained in software engineering and database design has been equally important, enabling me to build applications that are not only functional but also robust and scalable. I've also developed a keen appreciation for security principles, consistently implementing best practices to protect data and systems throughout my projects. What ties all of these skills together is my commitment to continuous learning, something I believe is essential in a field that evolves as rapidly as technology does.

          The artifacts I've included in this portfolio represent more than just completed assignments; they're evidence of my growth as a developer and problem-solver. My capstone project and supporting repositories showcase my ability to design, develop, and deploy full-stack applications while working collaboratively and tackling genuinely challenging problems. Together, these pieces reflect both the breadth of my computer science knowledge and the depth of my practical experience.
        </p>
        <p>
          As I look toward my professional future, I'm genuinely excited about the opportunities ahead. The foundation I've built through this program, combined with the real-world experience I've gained through projects and collaboration, has prepared me to make meaningful contributions to any organization I join. I'm ready to bring both my technical expertise and my passion for continuous improvement to the technology industry, and I'm eager to see where this journey takes me next.

            Course-Planner is a C++ application designed to help students and
            advisors plan academic courses. It reads course data from a file,
            stores courses in a hash table for fast lookup, and models
            prerequisite relationships using a graph structure.
